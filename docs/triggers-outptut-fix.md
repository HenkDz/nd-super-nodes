# Super LoRA Loader - Development Notes & Findings

## Current Status: STUCK - Empty Node Issue
**Date**: Current session  
**Problem**: Node appears in ComfyUI but shows only inputs/outputs with no content, buttons, or widgets.

---

## Journey Summary

### Attempt 1: Complex Custom Widget System ❌
- **Approach**: Built elaborate custom widget system with custom rendering
- **Result**: Beautiful UI but backend communication failed
- **Issue**: Widgets weren't properly serialized for ComfyUI execution
- **Files**: `SuperLoraNode.ts`, `SuperLoraWidget.ts`, etc.

### Attempt 2: Dual Array System ❌
- **Approach**: Added widgets to both `customWidgets` and `widgets` arrays
- **Result**: Duplicate rendering (user saw two of each LoRA)
- **Issue**: Both systems tried to render the same widgets
- **Fix Applied**: Removed from `widgets` array

### Attempt 3: Invisible Widget System ❌
- **Approach**: Custom widgets in `customWidgets`, invisible proxy widgets in `widgets`
- **Result**: Complex, fragile system
- **Issue**: Over-engineered solution, hard to maintain

### Attempt 4: "rgthree Pattern" Copy ❌
- **Approach**: Created `SuperLoraNodeFixed.ts` to exactly follow rgthree
- **Result**: Empty node (current state)
- **Issue**: Missing fundamental understanding of rgthree's base classes

---

## Key Technical Findings

### 1. ComfyUI Widget Serialization
- **Finding**: ComfyUI only serializes widgets from `node.widgets` array
- **Requirement**: Widgets must have `serializeValue()` method
- **Backend Expectation**: Data arrives as `lora_0`, `lora_1`, etc. in kwargs

### 2. rgthree's Secret Sauce
- **Observable**: rgthree uses `this.addCustomWidget()` method
- **Mystery**: We don't have access to this method - where does it come from?
- **Critical Gap**: Missing the base class that provides widget management

### 3. Widget Creation Pattern
- **ComfyUI Standard**: Uses `ComfyWidgets.STRING()`, `ComfyWidgets.NUMBER()`, etc.
- **rgthree Pattern**: Custom base classes with `addCustomWidget()` method
- **Our Gap**: Trying to use rgthree patterns without rgthree infrastructure

### 4. Node Registration Issues
- **Working**: Node appears in search and can be added
- **Broken**: No widget content, no functionality
- **Symptom**: `onNodeCreated()` may not be firing, or widgets not creating

---

## Backend Integration (WORKING ✅)

### Backend Status: READY
- **File**: `super_lora_node.py`
- **Expects**: `lora_0`, `lora_1`, etc. with fields: `on`, `lora`, `strength`, `strengthTwo`, `triggerWord`
- **Returns**: Comma-separated trigger words in `TRIGGER_WORDS` output
- **Tested**: Backend logic works when data is received

### Backend Processing Flow:
```python
for key, value in kwargs.items():
    if key_upper.startswith('LORA_') and value.get('on', False):
        # Load LoRA and collect trigger words
        trigger_words.append(value.get('triggerWord', ''))

return (model, clip, ", ".join(trigger_words))
```

## Fundamental Questions for Next Session

### 1. How does rgthree actually work?
- **Need**: Deep dive into rgthree's base classes
- **Files to Study**: 
  - `rgthree-comfy/web/comfyui/base_node.js`
  - `rgthree-comfy/web/comfyui/utils_widgets.js`
- **Question**: What provides `addCustomWidget()` method?

### 2. ComfyUI Widget System
- **Need**: Understand ComfyUI's built-in widget creation
- **Study**: How do standard nodes create widgets?
- **Question**: Can we use `ComfyWidgets` directly instead of custom system?

### 3. Minimal Working Example
- **Need**: Start with absolute simplest widget that works
- **Approach**: Single button or text widget that serializes
- **Build Up**: Add complexity only after basic serialization works

---

## Proposed Next Approach

### Phase 1: Minimal Working Widget
1. Create dead-simple node with one `ComfyWidgets.STRING` widget
2. Verify it appears and serializes to backend
3. Confirm backend receives the data

### Phase 2: Custom Widget Basics
1. Study how `ComfyWidgets.STRING` actually works
2. Create minimal custom widget that follows same pattern
3. Test serialization

### Phase 3: LoRA Widget
1. Extend minimal widget to handle LoRA data
2. Add LoRA selection functionality
3. Test trigger word collection

### Phase 4: Multiple Widgets
1. Add multiple LoRA widgets
2. Implement add/remove functionality
3. Test complete system

## Code State for Next Session

### Current Working Files:
- ✅ **Backend**: `super_lora_node.py` - Ready and tested
- ❌ **Frontend**: `SuperLoraNodeFixed.ts` - Empty node issue
- ⚠️ **Extension**: `extension.ts` - Simplified but may need revision

### Files to Keep:
- `backend/` folder - All working correctly
- `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` - This file

### Files to Archive/Study:
- `SuperLoraNode.ts` - Complex but had working UI
- `SuperLoraWidget.ts` - Good widget structure reference
- `SuperLoraNodeFixed.ts` - Failed attempt but good for comparison

---

## Critical Success Criteria

### Must Work:
1. ✅ Node appears in search
2. ❌ Node shows widgets/content when added
3. ❌ Widgets serialize data to backend
4. ✅ Backend processes data correctly
5. ❌ TRIGGER_WORDS output works

### Current Score: 2/5 ✅

---

## Debug Questions for Next Session

1. **Does `onNodeCreated()` fire?** Add console.log to verify
2. **Are widgets being created?** Check `node.widgets.length`
3. **Is drawing happening?** Check if `onDrawForeground` is called
4. **What does rgthree's base class actually provide?** Deep dive needed
5. **Can we use ComfyUI's standard widget system?** Try `ComfyWidgets` approach

---

## Research TODO

### Must Study:
- [ ] rgthree's `RgthreeBaseNode` and `RgthreeBaseServerNode` classes
- [ ] How `addCustomWidget()` is implemented
- [ ] ComfyUI's standard widget creation patterns
- [ ] Working examples of custom nodes with widgets

### Questions to Answer:
- [ ] Why do some custom nodes work and others don't?
- [ ] What's the minimal requirement for a widget to serialize?
- [ ] How does ComfyUI's extension system really work?
- [ ] Are we missing required imports or base classes?

## Final Attempt This Session: MinimalWorkingNode.ts

### Approach: Use ComfyUI's Built-in Widget System
- **File**: `MinimalWorkingNode.ts`
- **Strategy**: Skip rgthree patterns entirely, use `ComfyWidgets.STRING()` directly
- **Test**: Does ComfyUI's standard widget system work for us?

### What This Tests:
1. ✅ Can we create widgets using `ComfyWidgets.STRING()`?
2. ❌ Do standard widgets appear and function?
3. ❌ Do they serialize to backend automatically?
4. ❌ Is the issue with our custom system or something more fundamental?

### Expected Results:
- **Success**: Node shows text input widgets for LoRA name, trigger words, enable checkbox
- **Failure**: Still empty node → deeper ComfyUI integration issue

### ACTUAL RESULT: EMPTY NODE ❌
**User Tested**: Still shows empty node with no widgets
**Critical Finding**: Even ComfyUI's standard `ComfyWidgets.STRING()` doesn't appear
**Conclusion**: This is NOT a widget system issue - it's a fundamental ComfyUI integration problem

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS NEEDED

### The Problem is Deeper Than Widgets
Since even standard ComfyUI widgets don't appear, the issue is likely:

1. **Node Constructor Issues**
   - Our constructor might not be called properly
   - Extension override might be failing
   - Node instantiation problems

2. **Extension Registration Problems**
   - `beforeRegisterNodeDef` might not be working correctly
   - Node type override might be failing
   - ComfyUI might not recognize our node

3. **Base Class Issues**
   - Wrong inheritance chain
   - Missing required ComfyUI node methods
   - Prototype issues with our overrides

### DEBUGGING CHECKLIST FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Are constructor logs appearing?
   - Is `onNodeCreated` being called?
   - Any JavaScript errors?

2. **Verify Extension Loading**
   - Is our extension actually loading?
   - Is `beforeRegisterNodeDef` called?
   - Check browser dev tools for errors

3. **Test Node Creation**
   - Add extensive logging to every step
   - Verify node actually instantiates our class
   - Check if ComfyUI is using default node instead

## SOLUTION FOUND! ✅ (Updated)

### The Fix: Single JSON bundle + optional input
**Problem**: Our custom widgets weren't reaching the backend even when hidden widgets existed.
**Solution**: Build a single hidden text widget named `lora_bundle` that contains a JSON array of all LoRA configs and add an optional `STRING` input named `lora_bundle` to the backend node.

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Frontend**: `syncExecutionWidgets(node)` now emits one hidden widget `lora_bundle` with an array of configs.
2. **Backend**: `SuperLoraLoader.INPUT_TYPES` declares optional `lora_bundle`; `load_loras` parses it and outputs TRIGGER_WORDS.
3. **Result**: Beautiful UI + reliable backend data path. TRIGGER_WORDS now shows comma-separated triggers.

### Trigger refresh improvements (current):
- We exposed `syncExecutionWidgets` via `WidgetAPI` and now call it whenever a widget changes: enable/disable, strength +/- and trigger text edits, as well as settings toggles. This ensures the backend receives an updated `lora_bundle` without needing to add/remove widgets.

### Files Modified (Key):
- `frontend/src/nodes/SuperLoraNode.ts`: bundle emission + API exposure.
- `frontend/src/nodes/widgets/WidgetAPI.ts`: added `syncExecutionWidgets`.
- `frontend/src/nodes/widgets/SuperLoraWidget.ts`: call `syncExecutionWidgets` on changes.
- `backend/super_lora_node.py`: optional `lora_bundle` input; parse and output triggers.

### Verified:
- Output shows expected comma-separated triggers.
- Backend logs show parsed config count and returned trigger string.
